      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Over 80 decision-makers from European tourism organizations participated in the study. Respondents represented a diverse mix of destination marketing organizations, mountain resorts, regional tourism boards, and hospitality groups. The survey examined current digital maturity levels, investment priorities, and strategic focus areas for the coming years." },

      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "The first major theme emerging from the survey is the urgent need to better understand guest preferences and behaviors. Destinations recognize that building a comprehensive picture of who their guests are — what they search for, what they book, how they move through the destination — is the foundation for everything else." },

      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "The second focus area is the shift from mass communication to personalized, relationship-based marketing. Destinations increasingly understand that generic newsletters and one-size-fits-all campaigns no longer meet guest expectations. The goal is to deliver the right message, on the right channel, at the right moment." },
      { "type": "heading", "level": 2, "text": "Focus Area 3: Offering Customized Products to Increase Revenue" },
      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "The third trend centers on revenue optimization through customized product offerings. Destinations that combine guest data with e-commerce capabilities can tailor product bundles, pricing, and upsell opportunities to individual guest profiles — significantly increasing conversion rates and average transaction values." },

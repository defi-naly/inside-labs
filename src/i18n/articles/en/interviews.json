      { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Aebli points to multiple benefits: higher guest engagement, longer stays, increased repeat visitation, and more data about guest preferences and behavior. Gamification also creates natural touchpoints for communication — achievement notifications, challenge updates, and community interactions all provide opportunities for meaningful engagement." },

Successful gamification requires deep integration with the destination's core offering and a thorough understanding of what motivates the target audience." },
